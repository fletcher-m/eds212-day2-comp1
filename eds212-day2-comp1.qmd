## Derivatives in R

```{r}
fx = expression(3.1 * x ^ 4 - 28 * x)
# this is storing derivative expression
df_dx <- D(fx, 'x')

# This calls it back
df_dx

x <- 10
# evaluate expression with x = 10
eval(df_dx)
```

Find the slope of g(z) = 2z^3^ - 10.5z^2^ + 4.1 at z = 3.6

```{r}
gt = expression (2 * z^3 - 10.5 * z^2 + 4.1)

dg_dt <- D(gt, 'z')

z = seq(from = 1, to = 3, length = 20)

eval(dg_dt)
```
